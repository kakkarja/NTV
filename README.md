**Outline note taking style built in Excel with VBA as a Template/Workbook**

Please see the demo on https://youtu.be/wiChHB_mHos

Note:

Everytime you closed the template, it will asked you if you want to save under new name. If you choose **No**, it will save on default name. I suggets that you will always choose new name instead. Only when you are opening an existing file that already save under .xlsm file you may wanted to choose **No**(in order to avoid making too much duplicate).
