# Note Tree View
**Outline note taking style built in Excel with VBA as a Template/Workbook**

**Please see the demo on https://youtu.be/wiChHB_mHos**

## Note:

**There are 2 files of NTV:**
**1. The Template one can be install through MSI installer**
**2. The Workbook one is zipped and only contain NoteTreeView.xlsm**

Everytime you closed the template, it will asked you if you want to save under new name. If you choose **No**, it will save on default name. I suggets that you will always choose new name instead. Only when you are opening an existing file that already save under .xlsm file you may wanted to choose **No**(in order to avoid making too much duplicate).
